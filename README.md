# untitled-forest-game

This is a little prototype game in Unreal Engine 5. It's designed to have a very
magical vibe as you play a forest spirit who is tasked with brining balance to
the forest. It's developed as a 2d-3d hybrid game, but has inspiration from many
other games which are isometric 2d pixel art RPGs as well as top-down sim / rpg
games.

The game itself is within the [./UntitledForestGame](./UntitledForestGame)
folder and can be loaded with Unreal Engine 5. Please see the readme within that
folder for more information.

There is a
[wiki](https://github.com/Well-known-Game-Studio/untitled-forest-game/wiki)
which contains some documents describing some parts of the game design.

As we develop further, other assets / folders will appear within this repository
containing game design documents, blender models, etc.
